# Rocket Academy Coding Bootcamp: UFO Express


Splitting up the work
Part 1
1. Set up routes without forms
   1. Get all sightings (/)
   2. Get sighting by index (/sighting/:index)
   3. Get all shapes (/shapes)
   4. Get sighting by shape (/shapes/:shape)

Part 2
2. Set up routes requiring forms
   1. GET /sighting form
   2. POST /sighting form
   3. GET /sighting/:index/edit
   4. PUT /sighting/:index/edit
   5. POST /sighting/:index/delete

Notes:
- Achieve forms and visuals with minimal css and html (to be beautified in part 3)

Part 3
3. Beautify forms and layout with Bootstrap
   1. add nav bar
   2. responsive design (work on mobile view first)
