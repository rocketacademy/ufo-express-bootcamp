{"sightings":[{"text":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin I witnessed 10 or 11 spherical glowing objects in formation swarming and hovering near the top of Ring Mtn. -Corte Madera.  I very quickly ran up to 2 firemen emergency responders to ask them to quote \"take a quick glance at what is going on over here\".  They flat out refused to take 5 steps over to the side to look at what I was trying to show them.  They were handling some kind of a medical emergency, but it would have been really nice to have them witness this because this was highlight of the whole night.","date_time":"10/2/19 22:00","city":"Marin County","state":"CA","shape":"Sphere","duration":"3 minutes","summary":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin"},{"text":"Sucked a coconut tree up","date_time":"2022-02-21T21:37","city":"Singapore","state":"N/A","shape":"Fireball","duration":"6 min","summary":"Sucked a coconut tree up"},{"text":"Projected several beams of light","date_time":"2022-02-21T21:42","city":"Singapore","state":"N/A","shape":"Pyramid","duration":"4 min","summary":"Lightshow"},{"text":"Sucked a coconut tree up","date_time":"2022-02-22T20:26","city":"Singapore","state":"","shape":"Sphere","duration":"4 min","summary":"Sucked a coconut tree up"},{"text":"Whizzed around and poured a foamy liquid out.","date_time":"2022-02-26T00:49","city":"Singapore","state":"","shape":"Pyramid","duration":"2 min","summary":"Foamy Whizzing"}]}
