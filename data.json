{"sightings":[{"text":"Witnessed an orange, slow moving light. Was looking out my window and saw a orange colored, non blinking light floating across the night sky. Woke up my daughters to confirm what I was seeing. The object did not blink, was definitely not a helicopter. Very bright orange and moved slowly for about 2 minutes, disappeared behind the trees and did not see it again. Never seen anything like this in my life.","date_time":"2019-02-11","shape":"Fireball","duration":"2 minutes","city":"Black Mountain","state":"NC","summary":"Witnessed an orange, slow moving light.

I very quickly ran up to 2 firemen emergency responders to ask them to quote \"take a quick glance at what is going on over here\".  They flat out refused to take 5 steps over to the side to look at what I was trying to show them.  They were handling some kind of a medical emergency, but it would have been really nice to have them witness this because this was highlight of the whole night.","date_time":"2019-02-10","city":"Marin County","state":"CA","shape":"Sphere","duration":"3 minutes","summary":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin","created_time":"2022-02-23 14:08:49"},{"text":"Blinding lights all over the place, too bright I can't even see anything","date_time":"2019-02-12","city":"Alamo","state":"TX","shape":"Fireball","duration":"1 minute","summary":"Blinding lights all over the place, too bright I can't even see anything","created_time":"2022-02-20 17:46:08"},{"text":"Chaos everywhere, people flying, cows flying","date_time":"10/2/19","shape":"Sphere","duration":"2 minutes","city":"San Diego","state":"CA","summary":"Chaos everywhere, people flying, cows flying","created_time":"2022-02-23 14:49:53","updated_time":"2022-02-25 10:26:12"},{"text":"Blinding lights all over the place, too bright I can't even see anything","date_time":"10/2/19","city":"San Diego","state":"CA","shape":"Formation","duration":"1 minute","summary":"Blinding lights all over the place, too bright I can't even see anything","created_time":"2022-02-23 14:50:14"},{"text":"Blinding lights all over the place, too bright I can't even see anything","date_time":"10/2/19","city":"Alamo","state":"TX","shape":"Diamond","duration":"1 minute","summary":"Blinding lights all over the place, too bright I can't even see anything","created_time":"2022-02-23 14:50:35"},{"text":"Chaos everywhere, people flying, cows flying, screaming","date_time":"10/2/19","city":"Alamo","state":"TX","shape":"Boomerang","duration":"1 minute","summary":"Chaos everywhere, people flying, cows flying, screaming","created_time":"2022-02-23 14:51:42","updated_time":"2022-02-24 01:43:55"},{"text":"kamehameha","date_time":"2022-02-15","shape":"Fireball","duration":"1 minute","city":"Roswell","state":"CA","summary":"kamehameha","created_time":"2022-02-25 21:27:14"},{"text":"kamehameha","date_time":"2022-02-01","shape":"Fireball","duration":"1 minute","city":"Roswell","state":"TX","summary":"kamehameha","created_time":"2022-02-25 21:27:35"},{"text":"kamehameha kamehameha kamehameha kamehameha kamehameha","date_time":"2022-01-11","shape":"Fireball","duration":"2 minutes","city":"Roswell","state":"TX","summary":"kamehameha kamehameha kamehameha kamehameha kamehameha","created_time":"2022-02-25 21:27:59"},{"text":"adding new shape","date_time":"2022-02-08","shape":"Circle","duration":"1 minute","city":"Roswell","state":"TX","summary":"adding new shape","created_time":"2022-02-26 10:36:22"}]}
