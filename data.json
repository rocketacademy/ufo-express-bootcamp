I very quickly ran up to 2 firemen emergency responders to ask them to quote \"take a quick glance at what is going on over here\".  They flat out refused to take 5 steps over to the side to look at what I was trying to show them.  They were handling some kind of a medical emergency, but it would have been really nice to have them witness this because this was highlight of the whole night.","date_time":"10/2/19 22:00","city":"Marin County","state":"CA","shape":"Sphere2","duration":"3 minutes","summary":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin","submit_time":"Tue Feb 22 2022 01:31:19 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)","index":1,"dateInteger":1570024800000,"id":"sighting0"},{"text":"mu","date_time":"2022-02-18T00:42","city":"mu","state":"mu","shape":"mu","duration":"mu","summary":"mu","submit_time":"Sat Feb 26 2022 00:42:41 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)","index":2,"id":"sighting6"},{"text":"HEY1","date_time":"2022-02-23T11:55","city":"HEY2","state":"HEY3","shape":"HEY4","duration":"HEY5","summary":"HEY6","submit_time":"Wed Feb 23 2022 23:55:06 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)","index":3,"dateInteger":1645588500000,"id":"sighting1"},{"text":"Witnessed an orange, slow moving light.
